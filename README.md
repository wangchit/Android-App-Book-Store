# Book-Store-Android-App

The first UI contains pictures of 3 or more books. Each book should have a title with the picture.

If the user clicks on the picture, a new UI screen displays Book Details. 

If a user has indicated interest (they are able to do this on the “Book Details” UI for that specific book), the user can put a thumb symbol next to the book title.

“Book Details” UI has a button which returns back to the “Used Books” UI.

“Book Details” UI has a way for the user to indicate they are interested in this book:
• A checkbox to indicate interest

It permits “liking” of more than 1 book on the first screen. 
The like can be removed if the user changes his/her mind after initially liking it.
